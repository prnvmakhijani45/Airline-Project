# airlineproject
The aim of this project is to analyze the customer database, extract metadata and identify why some customers are flying in your airline while others are cancelling.

A lot of emphasis has been given to Feature Engineering where I have imputed missing values using the knowlege I have obtained from the data
Tools used:
WEKA - Attribute Preparation and Engineering for preparing for Mining Algorithm
Python - Data Acquisition and Conversion, Metadata Extraction and Imputation, Metadata Exploration, Prediction Modeling and Visualization

Modelling Techniques used: Deep Learning using Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest and Decision Trees.

Libraries used: Tensor Flow, Keras, Scikit Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
